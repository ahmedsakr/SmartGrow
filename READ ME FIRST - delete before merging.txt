These are the main files for the app, ie the ones that were edited. The rest are files to enure the app works
properly when launching it in android studio and were not edited. I've been having trouble with
formatting the data of the sensors to show up on the app (the placeholder is the one that is displayed
rather than the data itself). I attached a screenshot of the layout from the android VM. I will look into 
it more later today (Oct 27) and give an update before the end of the day (the rest of the files will be updated
later today as well).

Here are the guides that I followed
