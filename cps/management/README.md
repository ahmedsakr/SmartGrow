**Leaf Management**
===

This part of the central processing server is responsible for managing the two different kinds of leaves in the SmartGrow system: **Plant Endpoints** and **Android Users**. To be specific:

* Plant endpoints are actors in the system that provide sensory information of the plant being monitored.
* Android users are actors in the system that view the sensory information, and are primarily concerned about the welfare of the plants being monitored.

The **management** part of the central processing server will be responsible for properly managing the leaves such that they are treated in regards to their role.
